# SolarSystem
The aim of the project is to overcome the limitation due to the 
analytical solution of the "N-body" problem (which has no closed solution)
throughout a numerical implementation of the equation of motions.

The physical system is composed of the Sun and the 8 planets orbiting around.
The equation of motion for each body is obtained by applying the Law of
Gravitation to the I Cardinal Equation of Dynamics considering the influence
of every body partecipating in the system.
Consequentally, the system of differential equations is built.\\
The numerical method implemented for the computation of the solution to the
system consists on the IV order Runge-Kutta method.
